### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This repository is meant to be an open-source way of sharing commonly used system dynamics models. We have three different repositories for you to download from:

-	Genericstructures contains canonical models used in system dynamics modeling. These models are a good starting point for modeling a problem. 
-	Class-teaching contains model files used for the Designing Sustainable Social Policiesand Programs: A System Dynamics Approach class at the Brown School, Washington University in St. Louis.
